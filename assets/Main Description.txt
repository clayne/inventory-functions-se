This is an update of the excellent 'Inventory Functions' SKSE plugin, originally written by Quad2Core for 32-bit Skyrim, and found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53432]here[/url].

[center][color=#b9a374][size=4][b]AE Compatible version added (but not GOG, alas)[/b][/size][/color]
I've added an updated version which works on newest AE build (SKSE 2.2.5 for AE build 1.6.1130)

I'm not intending to do releases for any previous AE builds though;
there are just far too many old versions for me to go through and force-update my Skyrim folder to![/center]

[line]

I first updated this for the final 32-bit SKSE (thankfully Q2C included a source file, and also gave permission for the plugin to be re-used - I contacted a Nexus admin, and they confirmed it would be considered acceptable for me to host the updated version). With the (alpha) release of SKSE64, I've updated and recompiled this again, and on the assumption the original permission still holds, am hosting it here for 64-bit users.

Here's what is currently in the script:

[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]A Note about checking Spell Levels[/size][/color][/b]

If you supply a Level argument to the functions (eg 25 for Apprentice-level spells), the plugin will only check the FIRST Magic Effect on each spell for this.  Additionally, if testing for level 0 (Novice), the Magic Effect [i]must[/i] have a School assigned to it to be counted.

Explanation: [spoiler]
This is because spells can have many Effects assigned to them. The additional effects are usually enabled by perks: eg the Intense Flames effect on the Adept-level Fireball spell.  Since you need the Perk to unlock it, the Intense Flames effect actually has a level of 0 - which would cause trouble if you were looking for "spells of Apprentice level or less", and you got the Fireball spell back because its second effect is level 0.  

Furthermore (and regrettably), the vanilla game actually assigns Novice spells (eg Flames) a level of 0 - which is the default level, and used by a lot of 'maintenance effect'-type spells (ie, the sort of Magic Effect you apply with a Cloak spell to nearby NPCs).  Thankfully, these effects are also unlikely to have a Magic School assigned to them, so by testing the the effect [i]does[/i] have a school, it means we should only get 'proper' spells returned by the functions.
[/spoiler]


Some example code for usage - the first function is taken directly from the original mod page:

[font=Courier New]
import _Q2C_Functions

ObjectReference Property PlayerRef Auto
Keyword Property VendorItemPotion Auto

Function ReWeightPotions()
  int PotionIndex = GetNumItemsWithKeyword(PlayerRef, VendorItemPotion)
  While(PotionIndex > 0)
    PotionIndex -= 1
    Form potion = GetNthFormWithKeyword(PlayerRef, VendorItemPotion, PotionIndex)
    potion.SetWeight(0.0)
  endWhile
endFunction



Actor Property SomeEnemy Auto
Keyword Property MagicDamageFire Auto

Function CheckEnemyHasFireSpell()
  [color=#00ff00]  ; just send the Keyword argument, and leave all others at default[/color]
  bool hasFire = ActorHasSpell(SomeEnemy, MagicDamageFire)
  if (hasFire)
    Debug.Trace("The enemy has at least one Fire spell")
  else
    Debug.Trace("Well at least they won't set us on fire...")
  endIf
endFunction



Actor Property SomeAlly Auto

Function CheckAllyHasRestorationSpell()
  [color=#00ff00]  ; set Keyword argument to None (meaning 'don't match Keywords'), specify the School, and leave all others at default[/color]
  bool hasRestorationSpell = ActorHasSpell(SomeAlly, None, "Restoration")
  if (hasRestorationSpell)
    Debug.Trace("Restoration IS a perfectly valid school of magic")
  else
    Debug.Trace("Guess our ally won't be doing any healing...")
  endIf
endFunction



Actor Property PlayerRef Auto

Function ListPlayerSpells()
[color=#00ff00]  ; just send the Actor argument, and leave all others at defaults, to get a full list of spells the actor knows[/color]
  Spell[] actorAllSpells = ActorGetSpells(PlayerRef)
  int spellIndex = 0
  Report("Player has " + actorAllSpells.Length + " spells of any sort")
  while (spellIndex < actorAllSpells.Length)
    Spell currentSpell = actorAllSpells[spellIndex]
    Debug.Trace("Spell " + spellIndex + ": " + currentSpell.GetName())
    spellIndex += 1
  endWhile
endFunction

As per their original wishes:
[quote]Feel free to package this plugin with your own mods and use it for your own projects.
Please just mention me (ie Quad2Core) in a footnote somewhere.

All Credits are going to the SKSE Team![/quote]

I hope other people can find as much excellent use for these as I have!  Oh - and go give Quad2Core some kudos! :)
